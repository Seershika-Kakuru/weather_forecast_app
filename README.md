# Weather Forecast App
This project is a weather forecast app that allows the user to select a place, the number of days, and the kind of weather data 
(temperature/sky). Once the user provides the required inputs, the app analyzes the weather data for the next 'n' number of days for the given place
and provides a data visualization chart.
